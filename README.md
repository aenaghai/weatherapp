Built a 5-Day Weather Forecasting app using python, matplotlib, pyowm and streamlit.

The app shows the weather conditions for 5 days, sunrise and sunset times, wind speed, humidity and weather graphs for the minimum and maximum temperatures(in degree Celsius and Fahrenheit) for the next 5 days.
The app also tells about the other impending weather conditions such as whether or not there will be fog, clear sky, storm and so on. :)
